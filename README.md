Personal Portfolio by Daniel
This project represents my online portfolio, a personal website showcasing my skills, completed projects, and work experience. The website was developed using modern technologies such as React, TypeScript (TSX), Tailwind CSS, and AOS (Animate On Scroll) to create an interactive and dynamic user experience. The design is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Key Features:
Smooth Interactions: Thanks to the integration of AOS, every section of the site is animated as it loads and when hovering, creating an engaging visual experience.
Technologies: I used React with TypeScript (TSX) for building the user interface and managing state, Tailwind CSS for responsive design, and AOS for scroll animations and hover effects.
Content: The site includes information about my career, skills gained in the IT field, projects Iâ€™ve worked on, and contact details, including my phone number and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: React, TypeScript (TSX), Tailwind CSS
Animations: AOS (Animate On Scroll)
Version Control: GitHub
