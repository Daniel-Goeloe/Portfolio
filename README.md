Personal Portfolio by Daniel Goeloe Guzman
This project represents my Personal Portfolio, an online platform designed to showcase my skills, completed projects, and work experience in a professional manner. Built using modern technologies, the website provides a dynamic and interactive user experience, tailored to demonstrate my expertise and growth in the IT field.

The website was developed using React with TypeScript (TSX) for a structured and scalable frontend, while Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive and visually appealing design. In addition, Framer Motion and AOS (Animate On Scroll) have been incorporated to enhance animations, creating a lively and engaging experience when navigating through the site.
